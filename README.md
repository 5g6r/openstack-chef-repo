Description
===========
The goal for this set of cookbooks is to provide a set of roles and cookbooks to deploy OpenStack Compute, Object Storage and Image Registry and Delivery Service (Nova, Swift and Glance respectively) with Chef.

This Chef repository is intended for deploying the stable releases and currently supports "Cactus" and other releases will be supported as they become available (Diablo is coming soon).
