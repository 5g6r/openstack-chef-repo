* Open Questions
** Do we planning on sticking with distro-repos and for how long? When and how do we start supporting Folsom milestones or source builds?
** Are we deprecating supporting anything before Ubuntu 12.04/Debian 6/RHEL 6.2/Fedora 17?
** Do we want to use Environments for anything?
** Should we add kong and exerstack to the repo so people can validate their deployments?
** How agressive should we be on not supporting earlier versions of Chef and Chef Solo?
** Is there interest in supporting the EC2 API?
** What features do we NOT plan on supporting?
** We're going to want some CI and more testing for sure. FoodCritic, TravisCI and Jenkins?
** should we be using Chef-Librarian?
* Roadmap
** XenServer support
** LXC support
** Hyper-V support
** PostgreSQL support
** Fedora support
** RHEL support
** Debian support
** OpenSuSE/SLES support
