    http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1496 drop the recipe[apt] once that's merged and released

    http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1009
*** keystone
    removed monitoring
    understand use of osops
    why is there a sleep?
    tag and release 5.0.0
    gotta think Fog is a better solution to some of the Keystone manipulations
    need a keystone:client to wrap
    package "python-keystone" do
    action :install
    end
*** osops-utils
    should this be a data bag?
    need to read through this thoroughly to understand purpose
*** glance
    make a glance::client for other cookbooks

    rabbit setup seems naive
    Break out hypervisor support into separate cookbooks
    tag and release 5.0.0

    make documentation more consistent with other cookbooks

* Roadmap
** knife-rackspace v2, via fog or openstack
** knife-hp, via fog or openstack
** Testing, testing, testing
** Folsom milestones
** XenServer support
** LXC support
** Hyper-V support
** PostgreSQL support
** Fedora support
** RHEL support
** Debian support
** OpenSuSE/SLES support
** IPv6 support
* Open Questions
** Do we planning on sticking with distro-repos and for how long? When and how do we start supporting Folsom milestones or source builds?
   move packages into nova-install recipe, key off of attribute to determine which technique to use to get all binaries in place used by other nova-* recipes (nova as example), source can be a version of this
   keep a node['openstack']['version'] and node['openstack']['previous_version'] for upgrades, also node['nova']['version'] and node['nova']['previous_version'] for component-specific versioning
** Are we deprecating supporting anything before Ubuntu 12.04/Debian 6/RHEL 6.2/Fedora 17?
** Do we want to use Environments for anything?
** Should we add kong and exerstack to the repo so people can validate their deployments?
** How agressive should we be on not supporting earlier versions of Chef and Chef Solo?
** What features do we NOT plan on supporting?
** We're going to want some CI and more testing for sure. FoodCritic, Test-Kitchen and TravisCI?
** does search make sense for things like nova::common if you have 1000 compute nodes?
   would a data bag be cleaner? perhaps a notification handler that automatically updates it?
   as soon as the new search syntax is supported, switch to that (available now)
* Technical Debt
  Rackspace->Rackspace Hosting, Inc.
  there are a lot of :upgrades for packages rather than :install, let's clean that up.
  osops-utils as a stand-alone cookbook just for managing networks with Chef? LWRPs driven by a cookbook?
* Weekly Status 8/3
**  Goals for next week:
*** nova deployed and working
*** test using librarian-chef to manage mix of community and github-based cookbooks https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian
*** push openstack cookbooks to community site and Opscode github repos
*** start on the Quick Start for Chef and OpenStack
** DreamHost Chef for OpenStack Hackday August 21 in Los Angeles
** potential Rackspace Chef for OpenStack Hackday?
** onsite with Calxeda
** Hyper-V support coming soon

** cookbooks
*** mysql - still forked, waiting on new release with patch fixed
*** osops-utils - still forked, merging up waiting on license clarification
*** sysctl
